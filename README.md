# The Coding Standards and Guidelines Challenge

This challenge will help you become familiar with the most popular coding guidelines; It covers the most essential best practices every developer needs to know to succeed during code audits for junior developers.

> ❗ We strongly recommend reading the [coding guidelines lesson](https://4geeks.com/lesson/coding-standards-guidelines) before the challenge.

## 🌱 How to start this project

## 📝 Instructions

1. Wait for your mentor to open [these slides](https://coding-guidelines-challenge.vercel.app).
2. Try completing the challenge with the whole class, have an open discussion and make suggestions.
3. Once the challenge is finished, split into groups; as many groups as possible, as long as there is one mentor in each group. For example: If there are 2 mentors in a class of 10 students, we will have 2 groups of 5 students each.
4. One student at a time will open their previous codes and start discussing them with their classmates.
5. The mentor will intervene as needed to ensure the group stays focused and on the right path.
